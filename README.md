This project utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze a heart disease dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations. Key insights included correlations among features (age, cholesterol, blood pressure), gender and chest pain type distributions, and their relationships to heart disease incidence. The analysis highlighted critical health patterns, offering a foundation for predictive modeling and deeper healthcare insights.
